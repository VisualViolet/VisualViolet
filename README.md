- 👋 Hi, I’m @VisualViolet, but you can call me Savannah!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, cybersecurity, video game development, and web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in Coding Bootcamp through the University of Washington. After I receive my certificate, I plan to use my new skillset to join the software development workforce.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can contribute to! My number one goal is to learn new skills!
